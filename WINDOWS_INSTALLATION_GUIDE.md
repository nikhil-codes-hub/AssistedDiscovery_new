## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Application Launch Issues

**Issue**: `'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command`
- **Solutions**:
  - Python is not installed or not in PATH
  - Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"
  - Try using `py` instead of `python` in commands

**Issue**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails
- **Solutions**:
  - Update pip first: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
  - Run Command Prompt as Administrator
  - Install packages individually if bulk install fails

**Issue**: `streamlit: command not found` or similar
- **Solutions**:
  - Install streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
  - Verify installation: `streamlit --version`
  - Use full path: `python -m streamlit run app/Assisted_Discovery.py`

**Issue**: Application starts but browser doesn't open
- **Solution**: Look for the URL in Command Prompt output and open manually
- **Check**: Default browser may be set incorrectly

**Issue**: "Port 8501 is already in use" error
- **Solution**: 
  - Close any other running AssistedDiscovery instances
  - Restart your computer if issue persists
  - Check for other applications using port 8501

#### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Application starts very slowly
- **Solutions**:
  - First launch is always slower (30-60 seconds is normal)
  - Close unnecessary applications to free up RAM
  - Ensure you have stable internet connection
  - Consider moving installation to SSD drive

**Issue**: Browser shows "This site can't be reached"
- **Solutions**:
  - Wait longer - application may still be starting
  - Check if Windows Firewall is blocking the connection
  - Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
  - Disable VPN temporarily if using one

#### Azure OpenAI Issues

**Issue**: "Test Connection Failed"
- **Solutions**:
  - Verify API key is correct (copy-paste to avoid typos)
  - Check endpoint URL format: `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/`
  - Ensure GPT-4o model is deployed in Azure OpenAI Studio
  - Verify Azure resource is active and not suspended
  - Check your internet connection

**Issue**: "Model not found" errors
- **Solutions**: 
  - Ensure model deployment name is exactly `gpt-4o`
  - Check that GPT-4o model is deployed and active in Azure
  - Wait a few minutes after model deployment before testing

#### File and Folder Issues

**Issue**: "Permission denied" or "Access denied" errors
- **Solutions**:
  - Run application as administrator
  - Check folder permissions - ensure user has read/write access
  - Move application to a different location (e.g., Documents folder)

**Issue**: Application files corrupted after extraction
- **Solutions**:
  - Re-extract the ZIP file to a new location
  - Ensure ZIP file downloaded completely
  - Try extracting with a different tool (7-Zip, WinRAR)

#### Network and Firewall Issues

**Issue**: Cannot connect to Azure OpenAI
- **Solutions**:
  - Check internet connection
  - Temporarily disable Windows Firewall/antivirus
  - If using corporate network, check with IT about firewall rules
  - Try from a different network to isolate the issue

### Performance Optimization

1. **System Resources**:
   - Close unnecessary applications before running
   - Ensure 4GB+ RAM available
   - Use SSD storage for better performance

2. **Network**:
   - Stable internet connection (minimum 10 Mbps recommended)
   - Avoid VPN if possible during usage
   - Use wired connection if WiFi is unstable

3. **Windows Settings**:
