# Agentic Approach to XSLT Generation through Large Language Models (LLMs)

The agentic approach to XSLT generation through Large Language Models (LLMs) utilizes multi-agent frameworks, where autonomous agents collaborate dynamically to achieve a common objective: generating optimized and functional XSLT transformations.

## Overview of Agentic Frameworks for XSLT Generation

Agentic frameworks such as Swarm, AutoGen, CrewAI, and LangGraph play a crucial role in designing these multi-agent systems. They create environments where specialized agents can effectively manage complex processes such as data transformation, XML mapping, and dynamic querying.

### Swarm Framework

Swarm excels in managing multiple agents that can dynamically switch between tasks. It emphasizes the use of tools, context updating, and simultaneous function execution. For example, one agent may handle XML schema validation while another generates the XSLT, with the system coordinating its outputs in parallel. Swarm's flexibility fosters seamless collaboration between LLMs and software tools, thereby enhancing the efficiency of complex workflows.

### AutoGen

This framework focuses on conversational agents and group collaboration, where multiple agents engage in discussions or data exchanges to refine outputs. It is beneficial for generating XSLT that requires iterative conversations or dynamic user input, such as incorporating human feedback for real-time mapping adjustments.

### CrewAI

CrewAI introduces role-based delegation, assigning specific functions to each agent—one may handle XSLT optimization, while another focuses on validating business logic. This structured approach is ideal for systems requiring precise control during production and development phases.

### LangGraph

A graph-based framework that models task dependencies and supports cyclic interactions. This is advantageous for generating XSLT transformations that necessitate multiple stages of validation or looping through recursive elements in complex XML structures.

## Why Use Multi-Agent Systems in XSLT?

- **Parallel Task Execution**: Agents can work on different stages of transformation simultaneously, such as schema extraction and style mapping.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Optimization**: Frameworks like AutoGen allow for the direct incorporation of human feedback into the transformation process, ensuring high-quality outputs.
- **Dynamic Tool Integration**: Swarm enables agents to call external tools during runtime, enhancing the XSLT generation process through data retrieval or schema validation tools.

In practice, these frameworks expand the capabilities of RAG-based architectures, blending reasoning, action, and adaptability for complex tasks. Adopting a multi-agent strategy enhances scalability, allowing for the integration of new agents or tools as needed, thereby making the system resilient and flexible.

## Choosing the Appropriate Framework

Choosing the appropriate framework depends on your specific requirements—whether you prioritize role-based delegation (CrewAI), cyclical workflows (LangGraph), or conversational adaptability (AutoGen). Each framework offers unique benefits that align with different aspects of the XSLT generation process, from optimization and transformation to error handling and real-time feedback integration.

These technologies facilitate a sophisticated, collaborative approach to XSLT generation, transforming it from a static mapping task into a dynamic, responsive process that leverages both automation and human insights.
