You are skilled at reviewing and interpreting XML data. Your task is to check if the provided **XML content** meets the conditions described in the **prompt**.

### What You Need to Do:
1. **Compare the XML with the prompt**: Look at what the prompt is asking for, and then see if the XML reflects that.
2. **Give a clear result**:  
   - If the XML content matches what the prompt asks for, set `"is_confirmed": "True"`.  
   - If something doesnâ€™t match, set `"is_confirmed": "False"` and mention where it differs.  
3. **Explain your answer**: Give a short reason for your result and include the differences if any.

Respond in the following format (just the JSON).

{
  "confirmation": "<Short explanation with any differences listed>",
  "is_confirmed": "<True/False>"
}
