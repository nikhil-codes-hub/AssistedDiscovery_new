1. **Pattern Matching**: Compares uploaded XML against saved patterns
2. **AI Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o to verify pattern matches
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Provides match confidence levels
4. **Detailed Results**: Shows which patterns match and why

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Upload XML for Analysis
1. **Select Workspace**:
   - Choose the workspace containing relevant patterns
   - Workspace determines which patterns are used for comparison

2. **Upload XML File**:
   - Click the file uploader
   - Select your unknown XML file
   - File metrics display (name, size, analysis status)

3. **Pre-Analysis Check**:
   - System verifies pattern availability
   - Shows count of workspace and shared patterns
   - Warns if no patterns available for comparison

#### Step 2: Run Pattern Analysis
1. **Start Analysis**:
   - Click **"Start Pattern Analysis"**
   - AI processes XML against all available patterns
   - Progress status shows analysis phases

2. **Analysis Process**:
   - **Structure Analysis**: XML structure parsing
   - **Pattern Matching**: Compare against saved patterns
   - **AI Verification**: GPT-4o validates matches
   - **Result Compilation**: Generate analysis report

#### Step 3: Review Results

**Analysis Table**:
- **Airline**: Source API or "Shared" for team patterns
- **API Version**: Version information for context
- **Section**: XML section or XPath where pattern was found

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is AssistedDiscovery?**
A: AssistedDiscovery is an AI-powered XML pattern analysis tool that helps developers understand, extract, and manage patterns from airline API XML responses using GPT-4o.

**Q: Do I need programming knowledge to use this tool?**
A: No, the tool is designed with a user-friendly interface. Basic understanding of XML structure is helpful but not required.

**Q: Can I use this tool offline?**
A: The tool requires internet connection for AI processing (Azure OpenAI API calls), but pattern storage and management work locally.

### Configuration Questions

**Q: What Azure OpenAI subscription do I need?**
A: You need an active Azure OpenAI subscription with GPT-4o model deployment. Standard pay-as-you-go pricing applies.

**Q: Can I use regular OpenAI instead of Azure OpenAI?**
A: Currently, the tool is configured specifically for Azure OpenAI. Regular OpenAI API is not supported.

**Q: How much does it cost to run pattern analysis?**
A: Costs depend on Azure OpenAI usage. Typical pattern extraction costs $0.01-0.10 per XML file, depending on size and complexity.

### Pattern Questions

**Q: What types of XML files work best?**
A: Well-formed XML files from airline APIs work best. Files should be 10KB-1MB in size with representative data structures.

**Q: Can I extract patterns from non-airline XML?**
A: The tool is optimized for airline APIs but can work with any XML. Results may vary for non-airline content.

**Q: How accurate is the AI pattern extraction?**
A: GPT-4o provides highly accurate pattern extraction. Always verify patterns before saving for best results.

**Q: Can I edit extracted patterns?**
A: Currently, patterns cannot be edited after extraction. Re-extract with different prompts or contexts if changes are needed.

### Workspace Questions

**Q: How many workspaces can I create?**
A: There's no hard limit on workspaces. Performance may be affected with very large numbers of workspaces.

**Q: Can I share workspaces with team members?**
A: Workspaces are local to each installation. Use the shared workspace feature for team collaboration.

**Q: What happens if I delete a workspace?**
A: Workspace deletion removes all associated patterns and data. Always export important data before deletion.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Where are my patterns stored?**
A: Patterns are stored in local SQLite databases in the application directory. Workspace patterns and shared patterns use separate databases.

**Q: Can I backup my patterns?**
A: Yes, use the export features to backup patterns as CSV or JSON files. Database files can also be backed up directly.

**Q: What happens if the application crashes?**
A: Session data may be lost, but saved patterns in databases are preserved. Re-extract patterns if session data is lost.

**Q: Can I run multiple instances of the application?**
A: Yes, but they share the same database files. Be careful with concurrent modifications.

### Integration Questions

**Q: Can I integrate this with other tools?**
A: Pattern data can be exported as CSV/JSON for integration. Direct API integration is not currently available.

**Q: Can I automate pattern extraction?**
A: The current version requires manual operation through the web interface. Automation features may be added in future versions.

**Q: Can I import patterns from other sources?**
A: Patterns can be imported through the shared workspace management features, though manual formatting may be required.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: Why are my patterns showing random dates?**
A: This was a database column mapping issue that has been fixed. Restart the application to see correct API and version information.

**Q: Why don't I see extracted patterns on other pages?**
A: Patterns must be saved to databases to appear on other pages. Session patterns only exist during extraction.

**Q: Why does pattern identification show "No validation rules found"?**
A: This means no patterns are available for comparison. Save patterns from the Discovery page first.

### Support and Updates

**Q: How do I get support?**
A: Check this user guide first, then review troubleshooting section. For technical issues, check application logs and error messages.

**Q: How often is the tool updated?**
A: Updates are released as needed for bug fixes and feature enhancements. Check the repository for latest versions.

**Q: Can I contribute to the project?**
A: Contribution guidelines depend on the project's open-source status. Check the repository for contribution information.
